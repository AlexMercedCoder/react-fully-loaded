#### Created by Alex Merced of AlexMercedCoder.com/devNursery.com

This react template uses webpack as a bundler and...

- Has router configured
- Pre-Made Header and Footer Components
- The global state assets are configured in gstate.js, this uses my merced-react-hooks library, read the documentation at: https://www.npmjs.com/package/merced-react-hooks
- Sass is configured, you can use the already existing styles.scss as your global stylesheet or do whatever you want
- Several Utility Components available out of utility.js, feel free to customize them for your own use.
- custom hooks also available from - https://www.npmjs.com/package/merced-react-hooks

Otherwise...

`npm run dev` to run dev server
`npm run build` to build into build folder
