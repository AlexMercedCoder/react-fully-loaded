# React Loaded

#### Created by Alex Merced of AlexMercedCoder.com/devNursery.com

This react template uses webpack as a bundler and...

- Has router configured
- Pre-Made Header and Footer Components
- GlobalContext for managing App level state (just import GlobalContext from App and the useContext hook to access the global state)
- Sass is configured, you can use the already existing styles.scss as your global stylesheet or do whatever you want
- Several Utility Components available out of utility.js, feel free to customize them for your own use.
- custom hooks (useFetch and useAdjuster) included in the customHooks file

Make sure to remove the git repository

`sudo rm -r .git` from the root folder

Otherwise...

`npm run dev` to run dev server
`npm run build` to build into build folder
